# How to Use the Ephemeris Web App

Welcome! This web app helps you explore planetary positions (ephemeris data) and analyze transits with advanced filtering. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for students:

## 1. Loading the Data
- Click the **Fetch Data** button to load the planetary data table.

## 2. Understanding the Table
- The table displays planetary positions (Graha), Rashi (Sign), Nakshatra (Star), and more for each date.
- The **Result** column shows if a transit is Auspicious, In-Auspicious, or Neutral based on your Janma Rashi selection.

## 3. Using Filters
- **Date Range:** Use the From and To date pickers to view data for a specific period.
- **Janma Rashi:** Select your birth Rashi (sign) to see personalized transit results.
- **Column Filters:**
  - Click any filter button (e.g., Graha, Rashi) to open a dropdown with checkboxes.
  - Select one or more values to filter the table. The table updates instantly.
  - You can combine multiple filters for advanced analysis.
- **Clear Filter:** Click this button to reset all filters and show all data again.

## 4. Responsive Design
- The page works on computers, tablets, and phones. On small screens, the table displays as cards for easy reading.

## 5. Tips
- If no rows appear, try clearing filters or expanding your date range.
- Hover over table rows for highlighting.
- You can filter by multiple Grahas (planets) or other columns at once.

## 6. Troubleshooting
- If the table does not load, check your internet connection or refresh the page.
- For very large datasets, loading may take a few seconds.
